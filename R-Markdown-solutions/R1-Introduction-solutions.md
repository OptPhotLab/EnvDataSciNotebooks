# *README* before starting!

Welcome to Environmental Data Science's introducing R session. In this
session we start from scratch and assume no prior knowledge of R. We
will cover the very basics of the R language. Things like Rstudio and
ggplot2 will be covered in future sessions.


Fill in the blanks as you go to test your understanding, and keep this
handy as a reference for basic terminology.

Used R before?

It could still be worth going through the whole notebook or 
just particular sections; there might even be something you skipped over
first time round. 

On the other hand if you understand and can explain each of the 
following terms and how they relate to R, then perhaps this tutorial is
not for you. In this session we will go over:

* variable and operators 
* data types
* Data structures 
* lists 
* factors
* dataframes 
* matrices
* functions 
* applying functions.     

By the end of the session you should know what each of these terms
refers to. 

As an aside, the *dictionary* of programming languages
borrows heavily from logic and mathematics. This is especially true
for R, which is a language designed with applied mathematics (statistics) in
mind. Knowing the mathematical meaning of a word, e.g. a matrix is 
(imprecisely) a grid of numbers, helps with knowing what R is 
aiming for.


Let's get started!  

#1. Variables and operators

## 1.1. Variables
A **variable** holds a value, and has a name. The value of a variable
can change, hence being variable and not constant. In R we assign a
variable using the following symbols *<- , ->, = *, such symbols are
referred to as **operators**, there are lots of different types of
operators (more on those later!).

Let's name our variable *x* and assign it the value 1:


```r
x<-1
```
If we want to show the contents of x, we will have to use the *print()* function 


```r
print(x)
```

```
## [1] 1
```

The name of a variable should be unique, and can consist of letters,
numbers, underline (_) or dots (.). The variable should start with a letter
or a dot (this dot cannot followed by a number). Variables  cannot start with
a number or underline. Can you find which variable name
is incorrect?

* x.1<-1  
* x_2<-2 
* .x<-3  
* 4y<-5  
* _z<-6  
* _2<-7  
* .2a<-8*

Try each statement out here:



When something is wrong R will print an error message to screen. Make sure
to read this message carefully, and to digest and understand the computer
speak. If you do not understand then Google away! 

In the example above the final four statements are incorrect: 
* 4y<-5  
* _z<-6  
* _2<-7  
* .2a<-8*

and result in an "unexpected symbol" error message. 

##1.2. Data types

Every variable has a **data type**. The data type of a variable is its
defining quality, it is what it is! In R, there are several basic data 
types that we typically use:

* character: a 
* numeric: 2,0, or 5.6 
* integer: 4L (the L means R will store 4 as integer) 
* logical: TRUE, FALSE

The above datatypes are referred to as *atomic* in R speak. We will 
sometimes drop the data part of the word and simply refer to the
**type** of a variable when we talk about datatypes.

Create a variable of type character, and name it y. Print
it out in the same box:


```r
y <- "EnvDataSci"
print(y)
```

```
## [1] "EnvDataSci"
```

To show the type of a variable you can use **class()** command. 
What is the type of **x** from the above example?


```r
class(x)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

x is a different type ("numeric") to y.

##1.3. Operators 

We already met assignment operators above e.g. *<-*. But there are
lots of other operators too. Operators connect variables by doing
something to them. Perhaps the most obvious example is mathematical
operations, which are performed by the **arithmetic operators**.

###1.3.1.Arithmetic operators

We can add, substract, mutiply, divide, equal, expeonent variables
in R using the following **arithmetic operators**:  +, -, *, /, =, ^ 


```r
math1=5+6*8-9+5/6
print(math1)
```

```
## [1] 44.83333
```

```r
4^3
```

```
## [1] 64
```

###1.3.2.Relational operators

**Relational operators** are used to compare variables. The output
of such a comparison is a *boolean* i.e. a *TRUE* or *FALSE* value. 
We can use such operators to test statements such as is z greater 
than x? First we have to assign z a value:


```r
z=20
```
now let's test our hypothesis:


```r
z>x
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```
here is a list of operators: 

* ">" greater than
* "<"  less than
* ">="  greater than or equal to 
* "<="  less than or equal to 
* "=="   equal to 
* "!="   not equal to


###1.3.3. Logical operators

More logic here! You will notice that logic is a recurring theme, as computer
languages are rooted in logic, 0s and 1s etc.

*Logical operators* can be used to chain operators together. Again the output
is a Boolean *TRUE* or *FALSE*. For example, to test if x is greater than 0 and
less than 10:


```r
x>0 & x<10
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```
There are 3 operators in the above **syntax** (bit of code). Two 
relational operators and one logical, which is the & symbol.
There is also an or symbol: |.

How do you test if z is greater than 100 **or** greater than 1000? 


```r
z> 100 | z>1000
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```
z has the value 20 which is neither greater than 100 nor greater than 100.
The statement above is FALSE.

###1.3.4.Miscellaneous Operators

There are also a few other operators that don't fit neatly 
into any other bracket. The colon operator **:** is very handy as it
is used to generate a sequence of numbers:


```r
x1 <- 1:10
print(x1)
```

```
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```
The **%in%** operator can be used to check if the elements 
that occur in ** A ** also occur in ** B **


```r
A<-1:10
B<-3:6
print(A%in%B)
```

```
##  [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```


#2. Data structures

Put simply **data structures** are groups of variables. You can group variables
of different data types, however the simplest data structures occur when
you group variables of the same type. These simple structures are called
**vectors**.

##2.1. Vectors

A vector is a one dimensional array that can consist of
numeric, character,or logical data. All the elements inside a vector
should be a single data type only. A vector is formed using function
**c()**. 

Let's try the following out:

1.  create a vector named as a, store letters of b to e
into a 
2.  print a 
3.  check data type of a
4.  check the structure of a.


```r
#(1)create a character vector: a
a<-c('b','c','d','e')
#(2)print: a
print(a)
```

```
## [1] "b" "c" "d" "e"
```


```r
#(3)check type of a
class(a)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```


```r
#(4)check structure of a
str(a)
```

```
##  chr [1:4] "b" "c" "d" "e"
```
The structure command displays the structure of the object in question. In
this case **a** is character vector.

You should try the following:

1. create a vector named as a1, store first 10 numbers into a1
2. print a1 
3. check type of a1, and
4. structure of a1.


```r
a1 <-  c(1:10)
print(a1)
```

```
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

```r
class(a1)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

```r
str(a1)
```

```
##  int [1:10] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

In the above case a1 is a vector of type integer (whole numbers).

##2.2. Matrices 

If we extend our concept of a vector into two dimensions we end up with a 
2D grid of the same type; this is a **matrix**. Matices are created by the 
matrix() function:


```r
d<-c(1:20)
#create a matrix
matr1<-matrix(d,nrow = 5,ncol=4,byrow = T,
              dimnames =list(c('r1','r2','r3','r4','r5'),
                             c('c1','c2','c3','c4')))
matr1
```

```
##    c1 c2 c3 c4
## r1  1  2  3  4
## r2  5  6  7  8
## r3  9 10 11 12
## r4 13 14 15 16
## r5 17 18 19 20
```

Let's checkout the structure of our matrix:


```r
str(matr1)
```

```
##  int [1:5, 1:4] 1 5 9 13 17 2 6 10 14 18 ...
##  - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
##   ..$ : chr [1:5] "r1" "r2" "r3" "r4" ...
##   ..$ : chr [1:4] "c1" "c2" "c3" "c4"
```

##2.3. Arrays 

An array is similar to a matrix, but can have more than 
two dimensions. Arrays are created with the **array()** function


```r
x<-c('a1','a2','a3')
y<-c('b1','b2')
z<-c('c1','c2','c3','c4','c5')
mydata<-c(1:30)
array1<-array(mydata,c(3,2,5),
dimnames = list(x,y,z))
array1
```

```
## , , c1
## 
##    b1 b2
## a1  1  4
## a2  2  5
## a3  3  6
## 
## , , c2
## 
##    b1 b2
## a1  7 10
## a2  8 11
## a3  9 12
## 
## , , c3
## 
##    b1 b2
## a1 13 16
## a2 14 17
## a3 15 18
## 
## , , c4
## 
##    b1 b2
## a1 19 22
## a2 20 23
## a3 21 24
## 
## , , c5
## 
##    b1 b2
## a1 25 28
## a2 26 29
## a3 27 30
```

## 2.4. Lists

Next we come to **lists**, these are different to matrices and vectors because
they can store objetcts of different type.

Let's make a list containing lots of different types and display the
results ...


```r
alist<-list(c('b','c','d','e'),
            c('control','control','drought'),
            c(1:10),
            c(1L,3L),
            88,
            '%&()',
            c(0.3,2.34,6.57,0),
            3+9,
            c('4','9'),
            list(c(1,2,'g')))
print(alist)
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "b" "c" "d" "e"
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "control" "control" "drought"
## 
## [[3]]
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 1 3
## 
## [[5]]
## [1] 88
## 
## [[6]]
## [1] "%&()"
## 
## [[7]]
## [1] 0.30 2.34 6.57 0.00
## 
## [[8]]
## [1] 12
## 
## [[9]]
## [1] "4" "9"
## 
## [[10]]
## [[10]][[1]]
## [1] "1" "2" "g"
```


```r
class(alist)
```

```
## [1] "list"
```


```r
str(alist)
```

```
## List of 10
##  $ : chr [1:4] "b" "c" "d" "e"
##  $ : chr [1:3] "control" "control" "drought"
##  $ : int [1:10] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
##  $ : int [1:2] 1 3
##  $ : num 88
##  $ : chr "%&()"
##  $ : num [1:4] 0.3 2.34 6.57 0
##  $ : num 12
##  $ : chr [1:2] "4" "9"
##  $ :List of 1
##   ..$ : chr [1:3] "1" "2" "g"
```
## 2.5. Advanced data structures: Dataframes 

It is no exaggeration to say that **Dataframes** are probably the most 
important data structure used in R. Dataframes are liked matrices, with
the key difference being that we can mix up datatypes in the same 
object. This turns out to be incredibly useful in a number of 
standard data analysis problems, in short our data is never simple
and dataframes take care of this.

Dataframes are generated by the *data.frame()* function. In a dataframe:

* the columns are variables
* the rows are observations (the row
numbers will be object numbers) 
* all the variables are of same length.



```r
#create a dataframe
x=c(1:3)
y=c('a','b','c')
z=c(30,40,50)
df1<-data.frame(x,y,z)
#print df1
print(df1)
```

```
##   x y  z
## 1 1 a 30
## 2 2 b 40
## 3 3 c 50
```


```r
#check the structure of df1
str(df1)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	3 obs. of  3 variables:
##  $ x: int  1 2 3
##  $ y: Factor w/ 3 levels "a","b","c": 1 2 3
##  $ z: num  30 40 50
```

Try to create a new dataframe called **mydata**. This dataframe should 
have 2 variables and 4 observations. Mix up the types of the
variables:


```r
x.1 <- c(1.2,1.3, 4.2, 99.0)
y.1 <- c("1.2","1.3", "4.2", "99.0") 

mydata <- data.frame(x.1,y.1)
str(mydata)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	4 obs. of  2 variables:
##  $ x.1: num  1.2 1.3 4.2 99
##  $ y.1: Factor w/ 4 levels "1.2","1.3","4.2",..: 1 2 3 4
```
notice that y.1 is type factor.

## 2.6 Additional data type: factors

A *factor* is a kind of advanced vector, that is useful in some analyses. 

All the elements inside a factor are characters. We start by creating a 
normal character vector:


```r
#create a vector
treatment<-c('control','control','drought','nutrient','drought')
#check the type of treatment
class(treatment)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
Next we convert our character vector to a factor using the **factor()** function:


```r
#create a factor
treatment.factor<-factor(treatment)
#check the type
class(treatment.factor)
```

```
## [1] "factor"
```
The difference between factors and character vectors, is that factors
 contain levels which can be examined using **levels()** function


```r
#check levels of treatment.factor
levels(treatment.factor)
```

```
## [1] "control"  "drought"  "nutrient"
```
R also stores factors as numbers rather than characters, this has 
some consequences which might not be obvious. See here for
more details on factors https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/12-supp-factors/ 


# 3. Control flow: if statements and loops

Now that we have defined our basic structures (e.g. vectors) we can 
start to apply some fancier programming constructs. These fall under
the broad category of Control Flow, as they can be used to direct
your program.

In R, the body (main bit) of the control flow statement is usually
places in curly braces *{ code here }*. (note howwever that these
braces can be omitted if your statement only spans a single line).

## 3.1. The if statement

The **if statement** is one of the most widely used constructs in most
programming langauge. Put simply it allows the program to decide whether
to do something only if some condition has been fufilled. 

For example if x is below some number, we want to print a statement
that is true. To achieve this we would do the following:


```r
x<-10
if (x<50) {print('X is smaller than 50')}
```

```
## [1] "X is smaller than 50"
```
We use the **else** keyword to chain together multiple clauses. This
saves us retyping the whole construct over and over. 

First change the value of x to 100, then combine the previous **if** statement
with a similar **else** statement,



```r
x<-100
if (x<50) {print('X is smaller than 50')
}else{print('X is greater than 50')}
```

```
## [1] "X is greater than 50"
```
We can also use a the *ifelse()* function to achieve a similar
result to control flow statements. This works as follows:


```r
z<-c(1,10,30)
ifelse (z==10|z>15,'yes','no')
```

```
## [1] "no"  "yes" "yes"
```

## 3.2. Loops

*For loops* are programming contructs used to repeat stuff over and
over, in programming terms this is referred to as **iteration**. Iteration
is at the heart of solving problems using computing, the computer is 
put to task to repeat tasks that are either boring or impossible for
humans to accomplish in a reasonable time frame!

A for loop iterates over a sequence one element at a time. The for loop
contains the *for* statement, a *variable* in some normal braces, and
the body (main bit) of the loop is placed between the curly braces. The
body is where the repetiton occurs.

If we take an example, here x.seq is a vector that we plan to iterate over,
at each step (iteration) we want to add a new value (y) to the element
in x that is the subject of the iteration. At each step we 
also print the variable.


```r
x.seq<-c(1:10)
y<-2
for (i in x.seq){
 z<-y+i
 print(z)
}
```

```
## [1] 3
## [1] 4
## [1] 5
## [1] 6
## [1] 7
## [1] 8
## [1] 9
## [1] 10
## [1] 11
## [1] 12
```
Go ahead and  write a for loop where we square "i in x.seq", and also print the
resulting squared variable
at each step.


```r
x.seq<-c(1:10)
y<-2
for (i in x.seq){
 z<-i^2
 print(z)
}
```

```
## [1] 1
## [1] 4
## [1] 9
## [1] 16
## [1] 25
## [1] 36
## [1] 49
## [1] 64
## [1] 81
## [1] 100
```

*While loops* are similar to for loops, except in these loops iteration continues
until some condition is reached. In the following example we keep looping until
our x variable hits the value of 8 (10-2), then the loop stops.


```r
x<-2
while(x<10) {
  print('yes')
  x=x+2
  }
```

```
## [1] "yes"
## [1] "yes"
## [1] "yes"
## [1] "yes"
```
There is another type of loop called a *repeat loop*, these are similar
to while loops but to stop the loop we use the keyword *break* and supply
a condition within the loop itself:


```r
x<-9

repeat{
	print (x)
	x <- x - 1
	if (x==8){
	break
	}
	
}
```

```
## [1] 9
```

In most computing languages the above loops are similar in importance
to if statements. R is a little different in this respect, as there
are different methods of iteration that are just as powerful and
sometimes preferable.  These alternate iteration methods are the
**apply** functions discussed in the next section of the course. For
programmers coming from other langauges, it is important to remember
that in R, an apply function will typically take the place of a for
loop.


# 4. Functions and Applying functions

Functions are central to the way R works; think of them as the
building blocks of larger programs. Just like building blocks,
functions are elements of a larger whole. If you want to take the next
step beyond writing simple scripts, then functions are your friend!

In simple terms, a function takes an input, does something to it, 
then returns something else which is the results of that something.  
In R language, functions consist of *arguments* which are the input,
the *body* which is the bit where things happen, and the *name*, which
is self evident! 

## 4.1. Built-in functions

Most things in R involve functions, typically these are built-in to 
the language or perhaps part of a package that you have installed.

When you print something to the screen then you are using the **print** 
function:

```r
print("print is a commonly used function!")
```

```
## [1] "print is a commonly used function!"
```

You can take a look at the contents of a function by typing the function
name, but missing out the paranthesis:


```r
print
```

```
## function (x, ...) 
## UseMethod("print")
## <bytecode: 0x29a4000>
## <environment: namespace:base>
```

You can get information (help) on any function by placing the question 
mark operator at the front of a function (e.g "?function"), 
try it out with print:

```r
#?print
```

The code inside the function is called the *body*, the input to the
functions is referred to as the *argument*(s). 

Sometimes there is more than one function that achieves a similar
result.  Can you think of another function that prints messages to the
screen?


```r
cat("Hello")
```

```
## Hello
```
## 4.2. User-defined functions

Built-in functions allow us to get stuff done, however user-defined 
functions allow us to build stuff! 

Time to make a function. First we need our function to have a
purpose. Maybe our instrument has a linear calibration function. The
aim of our function is to calculate this calibration using our data
i.e. takes an input value, and multiply by a calibration coefficient
to yield the calibrated value.


```r
cal.eq <- function(instrument.data,cal.coeff=2.4){ 
       instrument.data * cal.coeff
    }
```

Next we should breakdown the individual parts of our function. The
name of the function is *cal.eq*, the body of the function is the part
in between the curly braces. Our function has two input arguments, the
first is *instrument.data*, and the other is our calibration
coefficient *cal.coeff* which is set to a default value of 2.4.

Now try to test out the function with some data,
x <- c(1:10)


```r
output.x <- cal.eq(x)
print(output.x)
```

```
## [1] 19.2
```

The result of our function is in *output.x*, a new variable.

One important note about functions; the output of an R function is
whatever is calculated on the last line of the body. In our case we only
have one line so that is what we get back. 

## 4.3. The apply family and anonymous functions

The *apply* family are a special group of functions that most R users
are familiar with. In essence apply functions are similar to for loops,
in fact in R when you find yourself reaching for a for-loop we often ask
ourselves can we use apply instead?

Apply functions iterate (repeat) a function over a
datastructure. Let's walk though an example. we can use the *paste*
function to join two characters together e.g. 'hi ' and 'there'


```r
paste('hi ','there')
```

```
## [1] "hi  there"
```
We could use apply to paste 'hi' to a vector of different words. We 
do this by defining a new *anonymous* function within the apply
call. An *anonymous* function is simply a function with no name!
Let's use the lapply function, as this is designed to work on 
vectors


```r
sentenc.e <- c("This "," is a ", " setence." )


# now lets use apply to mess up our sentence!

nonsense <- lapply(sentenc.e, function(input) paste(input," oops ")  )  
```
We have now turned out sentence into nonsense! However if you
inspect the *class()* of  nonsense you will notice that it is a list!


```r
print(nonsense)
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "This   oops "
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] " is a   oops "
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] " setence.  oops "
```

```r
class(nonsense)
```

```
## [1] "list"
```

This is because lapply returns a list. Lists are a little tricky
to work with. To convert back to a vector you can use another function:


```r
nonsense <- unlist(nonsense)
print(nonsense)
```

```
## [1] "This   oops "     " is a   oops "    " setence.  oops "
```
Now we have a character vector, just like our original sentence.

In R there are a bunch of apply functions, each one is intended for
slighly different inputs and outputs. Here are a few that you may
come across:

* lapply: input are vectors and lists. Outputs are list
* sapply: input are vectors and lists. Outputs are "user friendly"
* mapply: multivariate version of sapply. Outputs are "user friendly"


what is the difference in using sapply over lapply in the example above?


```r
nonsense.s <- sapply(sentenc.e, function(input) paste(input," oops ")  )  
print(nonsense.s)
```

```
##              This               is a            setence. 
##     "This   oops "    " is a   oops " " setence.  oops "
```

```r
str(nonsense.s)
```

```
##  Named chr [1:3] "This   oops " " is a   oops " " setence.  oops "
##  - attr(*, "names")= chr [1:3] "This " " is a " " setence."
```
**sapply** does the unlisting automatically.

# 5. Other stuff

We have only scratched the very basics of R in this tutorial, there is whole
world of resources out there! Many of them free due to R's ethos as
an open source language.  For programmers coming from 
other languages, be sure to check out *The R inferno*. There are also
a bunch of online tutorials for you to follow should you 
have time, Google is your friend here!

## 5.1 installing packages 

Functions are bundled together in packages (libraries). Each package
has a general theme e.g. ggplot2 is for improved plotting capabilites.
You can download packages using the *install.packages* function.
